<h2>All about you</h2>
<p>It's all about you, (its all about you)<br>
Its all about you baby, (its all about)<br>
It's all about you, (its all about you)<br>
It's all about you,</p>
<p>Yesterday you asked me something I thought you knew<br>
So I told you with a smile its all about you<br>
Then you whispered in my ear and you told me too<br>
Said you made my life worthwhile its all about you<br>
And I would answer all your wishes<br>
If you asked me to
But if you deny me one of your kisses
Don't know what I'd do</p>
